# PyTorch-NN-Image-Classification
Sequential Neural Network using PyTorch

## Image Dataset
The Fashion-MNIST dataset contains 60,000 training images (and 10,000 test images) of fashion and clothing items, taken from 10 classes. Each image is a standardized 28x28 size in grayscale (784 total pixels).

## Virtual Environment Setup
To run the program, copy the virtual environment in this repository: using the Anaconda command line, enter the command below.  
```bash
conda env create --name torch_copy_env -f torch_env.yml
```

## Model Accuracy
During the 1st epoch the neural network's accuracy was 80.7% and during the 30th epoch its accuracy was 90.5%.
